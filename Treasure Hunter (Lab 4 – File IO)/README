Treasure Hunter
Create a program that allows the user to wander through a map in search of treasure while trying
to avoid traps. The user starts at the upper left corner of the map and then they can move up,
down, left, or right, as long as they stay within the boundaries of the 7x7 map. The user can
receive a hint that will tell them the number of treasures and traps that are nearby. If the user
finds all seven treasures, then they win, if they run into any traps, then they lose.
