Rad Racer
Create a game where the user must choose a vehicle from a set of choices (Car, Motorcycle, or
Truck) and then race against the remaining ones. On each turn, a vehicle may choose to go fast,
slow, or to use a special move. The track that the vehicles race on has obstacles in the way. If
the vehicle is going fast, then it may crash into it, if they are going slow, then it can go around
the obstacle. The special moves are “Nitro Boost” for the car, which makes the car go 1.5x
faster, “Wheelie” for the motorcycle, which makes it go 2x faster, but has a chance of crashing,
and “Ram” for the truck, which makes it go 2x faster and also allows it to bash through an
obstacle. Whichever vehicle reaches the finish first wins the race. Use inheritance to implement
