CECS 277 – Lab 11 – Factory Method
Escape Room
Write a program that simulates an escape room by having the user open a series of three doors
that are randomly chosen from several different types of doors. The user may choose the
difficulty level, either easy or hard. Use the Factory Method design pattern to implement the two
difficulty levels. Easy doors are the BasicDoor, LockedDoor, and the ComboDoor. Difficult
doors are the ComboDoor, DeadboltDoor, and the Code Door. Use the following class diagram
to create your program.
