CECS 277 – Lab 14 – State
Puppy Simulator
Using the State pattern, create a puppy simulator program that has two basic functions: to feed or
play with the puppy. The puppy will react differently to these functions based on which state it
is currently in. The puppy has three possible states: asleep, eating, or playing.
