CECS 277 – Lab 12 – Decorator Pattern
Thanksgiving Dinner
Using the Decorator pattern, create a game that has the user add food to their plate without going
over the weight or area limit of a paper plate. There are two different base types of plates: a
small, sturdy 10-inch paper plate, or a large, flimsy, 12-inch plate. The plates can then be
decorated with five different types of food: Turkey, Stuffing, Potatoes, Green Beans, and
Pumpkin Pie. Each serving of the different foods has a weight, in ounces, and an area, in square
inches. The user may load up their plate at the buffet as much as they like, but if the area or
weight limit of the plate is surpassed, then their food falls to the floor
