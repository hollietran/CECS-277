Task List
Create a program that maintains a task list for the user. The user should be able to view the
current task, mark the current task complete, postpone the current task, or to add a new task. The
program will read the list from a file (‘tasklist.txt’) when the program begins and then store the
updated list by overwriting the old contents when the user quits the program.
